## libtextworker

An universal, cross-platform library for C/C++ and Python projects, mainly targets GUI apps.

Originally made in pure Python, and this C++ port has things that Python one doesn't have, hasn't things that Python one has.

## Build steps

Coming soon, and this does not have a build system like Makefile or Meson for now.

You will need:
* SIP for Python (not now)
* wxWidgets (optional, should be configurable later)
* Git

Tk is still in pure Python, not here yet.
